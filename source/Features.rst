Project Storage
---------------

Research Gateway will set up a shared S3 bucket(Project Storage) where the team members can store data. This shared storage will be mounted into all supported workspaces. Storage costs will be accounted for at the project level. For a lot of scientific research, data is stored in file format (e.g. fasta, fastq files for Genomics research). The natural choice for storage of this data could be S3 (inexpensive, highly elastic) or Elastic Block Storage (access is extremely fast). As part of project creation, we are creating project storage(i.e., S3 Bucket) and sharing it with users. At the same time, we would also like individual users to be able to access personal storage from their computing resources. 

1. The Project level storage will be listed as a product in the My Products tab inside the project as an S3 bucket. There is explore action inside the S3 bucket<<There is a folder called “Shared”.
  
 .. note:: It is a common folder(only accessible by the user unless shared)  and it is available to all users.

.. image:: images/Principal_Project_ProjectStorage.png   

.. image:: images/Principal_Project_ProjectStorage_SharedFolder.png  

2. You can able to view, upload and delete objects in the storage.
3. While launching any EC2-based product, the user will be prompted to mount the Project and User level storage.
4. The Storage will be mounted as a specific folder inside the EC2 machine which the user can use to perform any tasks on. Any data written to the folder will be synced back to the storage and will be accessible to the user upon exploring.


Cost Control
------------

1. Research Gateway can automatically create budget consumption alerts and take actions like pausing the project (at 80%) or stopping the project (at 90%).
2. When creating a project if you select the “Automatically respond to budget alerts” checkbox and it will open a pop-up box that contains a message, Once you confirm that it will control the costs by taking automatic actions when budget thresholds are breached. By turning this feature off, you will lose the benefits of this cost control feature.

.. image:: images/Principal_ProjectDetails_AssignUsers_Completed.png

How to edit the catalog type 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is an edit functionality for the catalog type. You can create a project without the selection of catalog type, once the project is active you can see the message "There are no Bring your own catalog type configured for this project" under the "Add Products" field.

.. image:: images/Principal_ProjectDetails_WithoutEditCatalogType.png

Once the project is active, navigate to the project details tab and click on the “Manage (i.e., Pencil icon)” option which is at the **Add products** field in the Project Details tab. Once clicked on that, it will display the list. Select the option from the list and click on the "Update list" button.

.. image:: images/Principal_ProjectDetails.png 

.. image:: images/Principal_ProjectDetails_AddProducts.png


.. note::

 a. While creating the project, if you select the "Standard Catalog" option it will create 7 products(Amazon Sagemaker, Amazon S3, Amazon EC2-Linux, Amazon EC2-Windows, RStudio, Cromwell Advanced and Nextflow Advanced). 
 b. If you select the "Bring all catalog items" option it will sync all the products which have the required launch permission in the portfolio of the AWS account.
 c. If you select the "Bring specific catalog items" option it will sync only the products which have the tag in the portfolio of the AWS account.
 d. If you select the “Use Project Storage” option it will create project storage at the time of project creation, if you unselect the “Use Project Storage” option it will not create project storage.


End of Day - Email report on  the running instances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The end of the day shall be deemed to be 8 PM based on the time-zone for each account. This should preferably be configurable at least at the instance level. 

Since Research Gateway supports multiple regions (and hence multiple time-zones), there is a need to only process those accounts which are currently at the end of the day. RG currently supports seven regions only but could support more in the future. So the mechanism to determine EOD should be independent of which regions are supported. Based on this, the best option is to have a scheduled task that runs hourly in the scheduler component. This task can then determine if any of the supported regions are at the end of the day.

You will receive a consolidated end-of-day - Email report(8 PM IST) for all your projects with details. You will see the report for active products only.

.. image:: images/Principal_EODReport_Email.png

.. note::

 a. The active users(Principal Investigator and Researchers) will receive the EOD report if at least one instance is in a running state.
 b. The Emails shall be sent only to verified users of Research Gateway.
 c. In the project events tab, you can see the EOD report generated information.

.. image:: images/Principal_Project_Events_EODReportEvents.png


Actions on Projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the project is active, we can do Pause/Resume/Stop/Archive/Add Budget actions on a project.

.. image:: images/Principal_ProjectDetails.png 

**Pause Action**

The project status changed to “Paused”. All the researchers under this project would be affected. In a Paused state new provisioning is not allowed. Users can continue to use already provisioned resources as before. All the available products would be visible but the “Launch Now“ button would be hidden.

.. image:: images/Principal_ProjectPause_Success.png

.. image:: images/Principal_Project_PauseAction_AvailableProducts.png

**Resume Action** 

The project status changed to “Active”. In the Active state, team members can launch new products from the catalog of Available Products.

.. image:: images/Project_ResumeAction_Active.png

**Stop Action** 

The project status changed to “Stopped”. In a Stopped state all underlying resources will be stopped and the user will not be able to perform actions on them but you are able to terminate the product. You need to manually start the resources except for the s3 product.

.. image:: images/Principal_Project_Stopped_SuccessMessage.png

**Assign To Projects**

The "Assign to Project" action allows users to associate a study with one or more projects, enabling the study to be accessible and linked to those projects.  

The "Assign to Project" action is a feature available on the Study Details page below Connect tab, which allows authorized users to assign a study to one or more projects. When accessing the Study Details page, users will see an "Assign to Project" button. This button is only visible to users with the appropriate authorization, such as Principal Investigators (PIs). 

Upon clicking the "Assign to Project" button, a dialog box will appear, presenting the user with a list of available projects. The user can then select one or more projects from the list. Initially, the "Submit" button in the dialog box is disabled until the user selects at least one project. 

.. note:: Internal studies can only be assigned to projects using the same AWS account and region. In addition, the list of projects shown will be the projects that the user is assigned to. So, if the PI is not assigned to some projects in the same AWS account, he will not be shown those projects. 

Once the user has made their project selection(s), the "Submit" button becomes enabled. Clicking the "Submit" button will associate the study with the selected projects. A success toaster message will be displayed to confirm that the assignment was successful. 

To cancel the assignment, the user can click the "Cancel" button, and the dialog box will close without making any changes. 

In case of any failures during the assignment process, appropriate error messages will be displayed, providing feedback to the user regarding the encountered issue. 

After successfully assigning a project to a study, the user will be able to view the assigned project list on the Study Details page. Additionally, the linked studies list will be updated on the Project Details page, reflecting the association between the study and the project. 

If there are no projects available for selection, the dialog box will display a default message indicating that no projects have been created or assigned to the user. This message serves as a prompt for the user to ensure that projects are available before attempting to assign them to a study. 

It's important to note that the "Assign to Project" action is not available for users with researcher or admin roles.

Lastly, when studies appear in the "Study Selection" pane while launching a product, the assigned study will be visible as a public study, denoting its read-only status. Users will have the ability to select the study, and it will be mounted to the instance, allowing them to access and utilize the study's information and resources.

		sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdf
    2. Create a folder
		sudo mkdir /data
    3. Mount the volume
		sudo mount /dev/sdf /data

You can run the following command in the SSH terminal of your EC2 instance to determine if the EBS volume has been successfully mounted: 
lsblk

The volume will only be displayed in the list if it has been mounted.
       
.. note::
   a. If you have already created the file system on the volume, then skip the command “sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdf”.

Integration with 3rd Party Identity Providers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In today's interconnected digital landscape, businesses and organizations often need to collaborate with third-party identity providers to ensure secure access to their services and applications. This integration is crucial for a seamless and user-friendly experience, as users can use their existing credentials from trusted identity providers to access various services. 

.. image:: images/Integration.png

**Integration Options** 

To facilitate this integration, we offer versatile integration options, allowing you to connect seamlessly with third-party identity providers. Two primary methods we support are: 

- **SAML 2.0 Integration**: Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is a widely adopted standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties. With SAML 2.0 integration, you can establish a secure single sign-on (SSO) experience for your users. This means that users can log in once with their identity provider credentials and gain access to multiple applications and services without the need to re-enter their credentials. 

- **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Integration**: If your organization relies on Microsoft's Azure Active Directory for identity and access management, our system seamlessly integrates with Azure AD. This allows you to leverage the existing Azure AD infrastructure for user authentication and access control, simplifying the user experience and ensuring security. 

Now, let's delve into the specifics of these integration options and how they work. Below, we'll provide detailed information on SAML 2.0 integration and Azure AD integration 

Integrating Research Gateway with a SAML 2.0 compliant Identity Provider using OKTA as an example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language, an open standard that passes authorization credentials from identity providers (IdPs) to service providers (SPs). SAML is the link between the authentication of a user’s identity and the authorization to use a service. It is the language that helps IdPs, and SPs communicate. 

Within the SAML workflow, OKTA can act as both the IdP (Identity provider) and SP. When a user requests access to a third-party application registered with OKTA, they are redirected to the OKTA dashboard. SAML is most frequently used to enable single sign-on (SSO), which authenticates accredited users between an identity provider and a service provider. 

As an example, we can do it with OKTA. You can follow the below SAML integration steps with OKTA. 

Configuration steps for Research Gateway application in OKTA
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Sign into your OKTA tenant as an administrator. 

2. In the Admin Console, navigate to Applications–>Applications.

   b. Click on the “Next” button. 

5. On the General Settings tab, enter an application name for your integration and upload a logo and click on the “Next” button. 

6. On the Configure SAML tab, configure the following things 

   a. In the Single Sign-on URL, enter the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL (example: https://enterprise-test1.rlcatalyst.com/samllogin) 

   b. Enter the Audience URI into the Audience URI (SP Entity ID) field. (example: https://enterprise-test1.rlcatalyst.com/) 

   c. Choose the Name ID format as EmailAddress and application username that must be sent to your application in the SAML response. 

   d. In the Attribute Statements section, enter the SAML attributes to be shared with your application.

For SaaS contracts, we only make sure that the customer is not using the product beyond the contract’s entitlements.


Securely managing multiple AWS accounts with Cross-Account IAM-Roles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to grant access to resources in your AWS account, another AWS account you own, or a third-party account. We are taking your credentials and creating the roles that’s why we want your IAMFull access/Administrator Access. 

Role Creation Process in Research Gateway
-----------------------------------------

1. While adding the settings once you provide the credentials, we will verify the credentials and give the required access.
2. Later we created the role and attached the required policy and this was created by Research Gateway.
3. We shouldn’t use your credentials in any other place.

Role usage
----------
Whenever the call is made to your AWS account we assume the created role and get the temporary credentials and proceed with the action.
